## Problem statement
* I am currentley part of a student organisation in which we have to do warmup exercises before we start training.
In these exercises we have to something for a certain amount of time. There are also different kinds of warmup (easy, medium and difficult).
I want to create an app in which the user can choose it's training and then uses this app to choose the prefered warmup.
This app consists of different difficulties and a certain amount of time for each exercise.

## Solution
* An app which simulates different warmup routines.
* 1. Working timers for warmup
* 2. Different warmup routines
* 3. (optional) feedback on how difficult the warmup was (do-able, hard and to-hard)

## Perequisetes
* Data sources: warmup routines: https://www.scienceforsport.com/warm-ups/
* External components: None
* Similar mobile apps: None
* Hardest part: implementing timers for each exercise
